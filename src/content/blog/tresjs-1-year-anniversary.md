A year ago, I was learning how to use React Three Fiber, a custom renderer with the power of creating 3D scenes declarately with React components and it blowed my mind ðŸ¤¯. 

Then, I did what I do best, complain in twitter ðŸ˜… ðŸ˜‚:

Yep, that was the panorama for VueJS developers like me back then. There were some initiatives like TroisJS, a manual wrapper of ThreeJS for VueJS that became unmantained and Lunchbox, who were the firsts to try to create a renderer. But, it was not enough for me, inspired by Pmndrs work and Thretle for Svelte I decided to create a renderer for VueJS, and that's how TresJS was born.

I started with a simple idea, provide the vue community with a ecosystem that would allow you to create 3D scenes declaratively with VueJS components and that was easy to mantain and extend.

For us it was important to solve the biggest problems of previous solutions:

- Keep it up to date with ThreeJS which constantly updates
- A good DX, we wanted to make it easy to use and learn
- Performant, even with reactivity. 
- Extendable, we wanted to make it easy to create new components and extend the core library with community-driven packages.
  

Although v1 was a decent solution ðŸ˜„ and we managed to achieve some of the goals, it has some limitations that would only be solved by using [Vue's Custom Renderer API](https://vuejs.org/api/custom-renderer.html).
